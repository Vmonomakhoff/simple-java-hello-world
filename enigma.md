Qu'est ce qu'un pod ? 

"A Pod is a grouping of one or more containers that operate together. Pods reside on Nodes; more than one Pod can share the same Node. The containers within each Pod share common networking and storage resources from that host Node, as well as specifications that determine how the containers run. Pod is an illustrative name, as they are designed to function like pods in nature, such as a pea pod. While a Pod can encapsulate many containers, typically each Pod is home to only one container, or a small number of tightly integrated containers."
